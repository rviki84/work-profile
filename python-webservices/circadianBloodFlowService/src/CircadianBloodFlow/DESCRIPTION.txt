Control case:

CircadianBloodflow('C:\Users\Toni\Desktop\temp\VL_DARE_150923M52CTR0002.csv', 115, 195, 52, 0, 1, 1, 47.2, 119.3, 4.8, 5.0, 15, 18)

MCI case:

CircadianBloodflow('C:\Users\Toni\Desktop\temp\VL_DARE_151028M78MCI0016.csv', 70, 170, 78, 0, 0, 1, 59.3, 81.1, 6.1, 6.2, 12, 12)

The program writes nine files in the OutputFolder: VL_DARE_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_cardiacOutput.csv, containing the 24h predictions of 
cardiac output, systemic blood pressure, and cerebral blood flow waveforms (MCA-L and MCA-R separately), and eight encapsulated 
PostScript summarising the model outputs.
